                <h3>The Birthday Paradox</h3>
                <p>
                  The birthday paradox is the counterintuitive idea that the probability
                  of at least 2 people having the same birthday in a group of 23, is 50%.

                </p>
                <p>
                  This project helps us simulate and visualize the Birthday
                  Paradox by running a series of experiments to test the probability
                  of shared birthdays in groups of different sizes. The program runs
                  multiple trials for each group size and calculates the percentage of
                  trials where 2 or more people had the same birthday. The results are shown
                  in a clear table format, showing group size and percentage.</p>
                <p>In this project my primary contributions where in the Birthday
                  and the Trial class. I worked on getting Birthday to generate random
                  valid birthdays and on optimizing the birthday comparison logic to
                  accurately check for duplicated birthdays. I also contributed to the writing
                  of unit tests to ensure accuracy and reliability. Tested Birthday with date
                  generation and edge cases, also Trial and Experiment with correctly identifying
                  duplicates and handling varying group sizes.
                </p>
                <p>In this project I practiced object-oriented programming using clean code
                principles like single responsibility. I deepend my understanding of random
                generation and data validating. Gained experience writing test and mocking
                objects using Mockito. This project provided experience with clean code
                theory and on how to write robust programs.</p>

                  <h3>Elevator Simulator</h3>
                  <p>
                    This Elevator Simulator project helps visualize the workings of an elevator system
                    responding to a list of calls.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Elevator Simulator project is a simulation that models the operation of 
                    various types of elevators a building. It simulates how different 
                    elevator models like standard, freight, penthouse, and express, respond to 
                    real-time calls from different floors. The simulator runs in rounds, where 
                    elevators move one floor at a time and stop when picking up or dropping off passengers. 
                    When idle, elevators return to the ground floor and wait for new calls. This project 
                    demonstrates core object-oriented design principles and also provides a 
                    user-friendly way to visualize and understand elevators and its scheduling.</p>
                  <p>The project had as requirements to display the elevator state throughout the simulation.
                    It has to process a file containing calls to elevators, assigning at most one call per round.
                    Each type of elevator has its own type of restrictions. For example, the freight elevator could
                    only contain one person at a time. There is also different types of scheduling, there is standard 
                    which looks for the first elevator to assign to. And there is complex that looks for the 
                    elevator that can service the call the fastest. 
                  </p>
                  <p> 
                    The project design takes into account the OOP pillars and makes sure to follow the 
                    SOLID principles helping the code stay flexible and maintainable. There is an abstract 
                    Elevator class as well as a Scheduler interface that encapsulate common attributes of its 
                    children. The elevators extend the abstract class to override and implement certain methods. 
                    As well, the schedulers implement the scheduler interface to give the methods functionality. 
                    This design also includes an elevator factory that helps stay clean and leaves the code open 
                    for extention. The abstraction in the project allows for better readability and helps focus on 
                    more essential features.

                />
                  <p>In this project, my primary contribution was implementing the scheduler and the simulator. 
                    I developed the logic for both the simple and complex schedulers to ensure calls are 
                    properly assigned to the most appropriate elevator based on the call. Additionally, I 
                    implemented the Simulator to manage simulation rounds, process elevator 
                    movements, and print the system state. Apart from implementing, I also participated in 
                    the ideation of the elevator classes as well as their functionality. 
                    
                    
                    Through this project, I learned to apply object-oriented and SOLID principles in order 
                    to build more maintainable code. I also saw how test-driven 
                    development can help catch issues early and help with code quality.</p>

                <h3>Valet Simulator</h3>
                <p>
                  The Valet Parking Simulator models the real world challenge of efficiently assigning arriving cars of
                  varying sizes and priorities to limited parking spots. In a mixed size lot, small vehicles occupy the
                  smallest available spots, VIPs receive priority spaces, and EVs park at charger equipped stalls while
                  minimizing driver walking distance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This project automates the entire parking process. It reads arrival and departure commands from three
                  interchangeable input sources: console prompts, random generation, or a CSV file. Each command is
                  parsed into a Move object, and a configurable assignment strategy selects the best ParkingSpot. The
                  lot layout itself loads from a CSV so you can model any combination of spot sizes, EV chargers, and
                  VIP reserves. After processing all moves, the simulator displays a status report showing which spots
                  are free or occupied.</p>
                <p>My primary contributions centered on developing the Simulator class and building the InputTechnique
                  implementations. I designed and implemented the console-based UserInput, the RandomInput generator,
                  and the FileInput CSV reader, then integrated them into the Simulator’s orchestration loop. I also
                  collaborated on wiring in the MoveParser and VehicleFactory so that raw commands seamlessly become
                  typed Vehicle objects, and ensured the core loop correctly drives Valet and ParkingLot interactions.
                </p>
                <p>Through this project I deepened my understanding of object oriented design, applying SOLID principles,
                  the Strategy and Factory patterns, and clear SRP. I gained hands on experience with console and file
                  IO parsing, writing robust unit tests for I O heavy classes, and controlling an integrated system.
                  This work sharpened my skills in designing extensible and maintainable software.</p>
