                <h3>The Birthday Paradox</h3>
                <p>
                  The birthday paradox is the counterintuitive idea that the probability
                  of at least 2 people having the same birthday in a group of 23, is 50%.

                </p>
                <p>
                  This project helps us simulate and visualize the Birthday
                  Paradox by running a series of experiments to test the probability
                  of shared birthdays in groups of different sizes. The program runs
                  multiple trials for each group size and calculates the percentage of
                  trials where 2 or more people had the same birthday. The results are shown
                  in a clear table format, showing group size and percentage.</p>
                <p>In this project my primary contributions where in the Birthday
                  and the Trial class. I worked on getting Birthday to generate random
                  valid birthdays and on optimizing the birthday comparison logic to
                  accurately check for duplicated birthdays. I also contributed to the writing
                  of unit tests to ensure accuracy and reliability. Tested Birthday with date
                  generation and edge cases, also Trial and Experiment with correctly identifying
                  duplicates and handling varying group sizes.
                </p>
                <p>In this project I practiced object-oriented programming using clean code
                principles like single responsibility. I deepend my understanding of random
                generation and data validating. Gained experience writing test and mocking
                objects using Mockito. This project provided experience with clean code

                  <h3>Elevator Simulator</h3>
                  <p>
                    This Elevator Simulator project helps vizualize the workings of an elevator system
                    responding to a list of calls.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Elevator Simulator project is a simulation that models the operation of 
                    various types of elevators a building. It simulates how different 
                    elevator models like standard, freight, penthouse, and express, respond to 
                    real-time calls from different floors. The simulator runs in rounds, where 
                    elevators move one floor at a time and stop when picking up or dropping off passengers. 
                    When idle, elevators return to the ground floor and wait for new calls. This project 
                    demonstrates core object-oriented design principles and also provides a 
                    user-friendly way to visualize and understand elevators and its scheduling.</p>
                  <p>The project had as requirements to display the elevator state throughout the simulation.
                    It has to process a file containing calls to elevators, assigning at most one call per round.
                    Each type of elevator has its own type of restrictions. For example, the freight elevator could
                    only contain one person at a time. There is also different types of scheduling, there is standard 
                    which looks for the first elevator to assign to. And there is complex that looks for the 
                    elevator that can service the call the fastest. 
                  </p>
                  <p> 
                    The project design takes into account the OOP pillars and makes sure to follow the 
                    SOLID principles helping the code stay flexible and maintainable. There is an abstract 
                    Elevator class as well as a Scheduler interface that encapsulate common attributes of its 
                    children. The elevators extend the abstract class to override and implement certain methods. 
                    As well, the schedulers implement the scheduler interface to give the methods functionality. 
                    This design also includes an elevator factory that helps stay clean and leaves the code open 
                    for extention. The abstraction in the project allows for better readability and helps focus on 
                    more essential features.
                  </p>

                />
                  <p>In this project, my primary contribution was implementing the scheduler and the simulator. 
                    I developed the logic for both the simple and complex schedulers to ensure calls are 
                    properly assigned to the most appropriate elevator based on the call. Additionally, I 
                    implemented the Simulator to manage simulation rounds, process elevator 
                    movements, and print the system state. Apart from implementing, I also participated in 
                    the ideation of the elevator classes as well as their functionality. 
                    
                    
                    Through this project, I learned to apply object-oriented and SOLID principles in order 
                    to build more maintainable code. I also saw how test-driven 
                    development can help catch issues early and help with code quality.</p>
